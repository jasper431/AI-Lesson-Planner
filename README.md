# AI-Lesson-Planner
AI can assist educators in designing lesson plans.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can assist educators in designing lesson plans aligned to Ohio Career-Tech IT standards. It generates scaffolded activities, rubrics, and worksheets that save time while maintaining rigor.

## Problem
Teachers often spend hours creating lesson plans that meet state standards and adapt to diverse student needs. This process is time-consuming and repetitive.

## Solution
The AI Lesson Planner uses Python and AI APIs to:
- Generate lesson outlines aligned to Ohio Career-Tech IT standards.
- Suggest scaffolded activities for programming and OOP concepts.
- Produce worksheet-ready prompts and rubrics in bilingual formats.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Copilot / Gemini for prompt generation
- Pandas for data handling
- OpenAI / Hugging Face API (optional)

## Demo
Example output:
- A 45-minute Python OOP lesson aligned to Ohio standards.
- Worksheet-ready activity: "Design a class for a bicycle with attributes and methods."

## How to Run
